# Study Buddy
_**2019 Griffith Hackathon entry**_

A web appliction developed to help Griffith students study. The main feature of the application aims to connect students studying the same course in-the-moment, increasing the sociability and learning opportunities for the students studying. Studying with a group creates an atmosphere of collaboration and togetherness, helping each group member remain motivated while trying to understand difficult concepts, and providing a network of support if group members are struggling â€“ you may even make lifelong friends along the way!

Some other [future] features of the app include:
- Student schedule
  - a view for a student to view their course timetable
  - a timeline view of assessments, providing a visual for how long students have until an assignment is due or when an exam is scheduled
- Social events
  - a calendar of social events run by the SRC (free food trucks, rock climbing, etc)
